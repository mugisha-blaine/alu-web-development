    <h1> Leadership</h1>
    <p> Leadership is not about titles or the corner office. 
        It’s about the willingness to step up, put yourself out there, and lean into courage. 
        The world is desperate for braver leaders. It’s time for all of us to step up. </p>

    <h2> Self-awareness and self-love matter. Who we are is how we lead.</h2>
    <p> The greatest barrier to courageous leadership is not fear—it’s how we respond to our fear. 
        Our armor—the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that we use to protect ourselves when we aren’t willing and able to rumble
        with vulnerability—move us out of alignment with our values,
        corrode trust with our colleagues and teams, and prevent us from being our most courageous selves.</p>
    
    <h3> Courage is contagious</h3>
    <p> To scale daring leadership and build courage in teams and organizations,
         we have to cultivate a culture in which brave work, tough conversations,
         and whole hearts are the expectation, and armor is not necessary or rewarded.</p>

     <p> The skill sets that make up courage are not new;
         they’ve been aspirational leadership skills for as long as there have been leaders. </p>
